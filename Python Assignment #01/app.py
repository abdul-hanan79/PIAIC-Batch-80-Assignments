# Answer 1
principal = 5000 
rate = 8
time = 1
amount = principal * (1 + rate / 100) ** time
print("Answer 1: Amount after 1 year:", amount)

# Answer 2
radius=7
height=10
total_surface_area = 2 * 3.14 * radius**2 + 2 * 3.14 * radius * height
print("Answer 2: Total Surface Area of the Cylinder:", total_surface_area)

# Answer 3
hours=2
minutes=46
seconds=40
total_seconds=(hours*60*60)+(minutes*60)+seconds
print("Answer 3: Total Seconds:", total_seconds)

# Answer 4
total_bill = 2750
tip = 10
number_of_people = 5
tip_amount = (tip / 100) * total_bill
total_amount = total_bill + tip_amount

# Answer 7
price=1000
first_discount=1000*10/100
