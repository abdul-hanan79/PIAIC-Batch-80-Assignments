Assignment for the week is :

Calculate the final amount with compound interest (for 1 year, compounded annually)
Principal = 5000, Rate = 8%, Time = 1 year
(Formula: A = P × (1 + R/100)^T)
(Use exponent operator **)

Find the total surface area of a cylinder
Radius = 7, Height = 10
(Formula: TSA = 2πr² + 2πrh)

Convert time into total seconds
Hours = 2, Minutes = 46, Seconds = 40

Split a restaurant bill including tip
Total bill = 2750, Tip = 10%, Number of people = 5
(Each person pays...?)


Calculate weighted average marks
Math = 80 (weight 3), Physics = 75 (weight 4), Chemistry = 70 (weight 3)
(Formula: Weighted Avg = Σ(score × weight) / Σ(weights))

Convert speed from km/hr to m/sec and then calculate time to cover a certain distance
Speed = 72 km/h, Distance = 500 meters
(Speed in m/s = speed × 5/18, then time = distance / speed)

Calculate effective discount after two successive discounts
Original price = 1000, First discount = 10%, Second discount = 5%
(Apply one after another)

Calculate the average of 5 numbers after increasing each by 10%
Numbers: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500

Convert a total number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds
Total seconds = 10,000
(Use integer division and modulus)

Calculate the monthly EMI (Simple version)
Principal = 1,00,000, Rate = 12% annual, Time = 1 year
(Monthly EMI = P × R × (1 + R)^N / ((1 + R)^N – 1)) — simplified:
use R = monthly interest rate (i.e., 0.01), N = total months
You can give them a simplified expression to plug in and solve
